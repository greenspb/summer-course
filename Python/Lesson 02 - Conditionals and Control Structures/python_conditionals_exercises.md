# Hands-On: Python Conditional Statements

These exercises focus on using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control program flow. You'll work with comparison operators, logical operators, and data types from Lesson 1 to make decisions in your code.  Write each exercise as a separate python script.

### Exercise 1: Check if a Number is Positive

**Goal**: Write a Python Script that asks a user for an integer number, and then checks if the number is positive using an `if` statement.


✅ *Check*: Should print "The number is positive" if the number is greater than 0.
```python
def user_int_pos() -> None:
    user_num = input("Enter an integer: ")
    while True:
        try:
            user_num = int(user_num)
            break
        except:
            print("That is not an integer. Try again.")
            user_num = input("Enter an integer: ")
    if user_num > 0:
        print("The number is positive")

user_int_pos()      
```
---

### Exercise 2: Even or Odd

**Goal**: Write a Python script that asks a user for an integer number.  Check if the number is even or odd using `if` and `else`.



✅ *Check*: Should print "Even" or "Odd" based on the number.
```python
"""Note: This function does not accept 0 as user input."""
def user_int_even_odd() -> None:
    user_num = input("Enter an integer: ")
    while True:
        try:
            user_num = int(user_num)
            1/user_num  #test division by 0
            break
        except:
            print("That is not an acceptable integer. Try again.")
            user_num = input("Enter an integer: ")
