## Hands-On #1 Exercises

This guide walks you through the basic Git workflow: initializing a repository, making changes, staging, committing, and viewing history.  This uses a series of Linux commands to manipulate the files.  If you are not familiar with Linux commands, you may want to seek out a Linux primer or cheatsheet.  (Example:  https://linuxjourney.com/)

---
### Exercise 0:

**Goal**: Get a working environment for git

1. Open a WSL terminal
```bash
wsl
cd ~
nano .bashrc
#can add cd~ at the end of the contents of .bashrc to always open wsl at home folder
```
2. Verify that `git` is installed by running the command `git --version`
3. If `git` is not installed, install it by running `apt install git -y`


### Exercise 1: Initialize a Git Repository

**Goal**: Create a new directory and initialize it as a Git repository.

**Hint**: Make this directory from inside of your home directory (e.g. `~/git_intro`).

✅ *Check*: Run `ls -la` to verify that a `.git` directory was created.  Git stores all of its tracking information in a series of files in the `.git` directory.

```bash
mkdir new_directory
cd new_directory
git init
```
---

### Exercise 2: Create and Modify a File

**Goal**: Create a file and add some content.


✅ *Check*: Run 'ls' to see the created file in your directory. Run `git status` to see the untracked file.  Read the output carefully.  Which branch are you on?  What are "untracked" files?  
INFO: Line 1 Creates the hello.txt file and adds the line "Hello, Git!"  
INFO: Line 2 'cat' is short for concatenate, it chains files together into a single output, in this example, your screen is the default output

```bash
touch new_file
ls
git status
```

---

### Exercise 3: Stage the File

**Goal**: Add the file to the staging area.


✅ *Check*: Run `git status` again and verify that the change is staged.  How is the output of `git status` different than the previous step? You can specify a directory to stage all changes in that directory at once.
```bash
git add .
git status
```
---

### Exercise 4: Commit the File

**Goal**: Commit the staged file with a message.

Git keeps a log of all your commits.  Before we make any commits, let's see what the history says.

What does the output show?  Now commit your staged change with a descriptive message.


✅ *Check*: Run `git status` to see the new status, run `git log` to see your first commit.
```bash
git log
git commit -m "new commit with new_file"
git log
```
---

### Exercise 5: Make a Change and Commit Again

**Goal**: Modify the file, stage, and commit the changes.


✅ *Check*: Use `git log` and `cat hello.txt` to verify your commit and file contents.
```bash
git log
echo "hello" >> newfile
git status
git add .
git commit -m "append 'hello' to new file"
git status
git log
```
---

### Exercise 6: Commit a Second File

**Goal**: Check what happens with unstaged files (no commands for you this time!)

Create a second and third file, but only stage and commit the second file.


✅ *Check*: Run `git status` (should show nothing to commit), and `git log --oneline` to see a summary of commits.
```bash
touch second
touch third
git add second
git commit -m "only staged and commit second file, not third"
git log
git status
```
---

## Hands-On #2 Exercises

### Exercise 7: View History and Changes

**Goal**: Explore the commit history and file diffs.


✅ *Try*: Use `git show <commit-hash>` to view the details of a specific commit. 
```bash
git show 3ca56cecd096530444d11c5abd3e7d1ce4990d47
```

### Exercise 8: View a Specific Commit

**Goal**: Use `git show` to view details of a specific commit.


✅ *Tip*: Replace `<commit-hash>` (it should be 7 characters on the left side) with the short hash from `git log --oneline`.
```bash
git show 3ca56ce
```
---

### Exercise 9: View Differences Between Commits

**Goal**: Compare two commits.


✅ *Example*: Compare two specific commits to see what changed between them.
```bash
git diff b56b6c8 861101f
```
---

### Exercise 10: See File History

**Goal**: View the commit history for a single file.


✅ *Try*: Add `-p` to view diffs in each commit:
```bash
git log -p
```
---

### Exercise 11: Check What Changed Before Staging

**Goal**: View changes to files before staging.


✅ *Check*: The output will show changes that are unstaged.
```bash
echo "goodbye" >> newfile
git diff
```
---

### Exercise 12: Check What is Staged

**Goal**: View what has been staged before committing.


✅ *Check*: This shows differences between the index (staged area) and the last commit.
```bash
git add .
git diff --cached
```
---

## Stretch Goals

**Goal**:  Try to recover after a bad change or commit.

Sometimes people do things they don't mean to and commit bad changes.  Try to revert one of your changes and go back to an old commit.
```bash
#option 1, modify the last commit
git log --oneline
echo "hello\nwhat a lovely day" > newfile 
git commit --amend
git log --oneline
#option 2, undo the last commit but keep the changes unstaged
git reset HEAD~
git log --oneline
git diff
git add newfile
git commit -m "isn't it a lovely day"
git log --oneline
#option 3, create a new commit that reverses a specific commit
git log --oneline
```
For extra double bonus points, start making changes off of that old commit and see what happens with things like `git log`.
