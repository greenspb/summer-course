## Hands-On #1: Git Branching and Merging

These exercises guide you through creating branches, merging them, resolving conflicts, and using different merge strategies.

---

### Exercise 1: Create and Switch to a Branch

**Goal**: Create a new branch named `feature-a` and switch to it.


✅ *Check*: Use `git branch` to confirm you are now on `feature-a`.
```bash
git switch -c feature-a
git branch
```
---

### Exercise 2: Make a Change in the Feature Branch

**Goal**: Edit `notes.txt` and add a line describing feature A.


✅ *Check*: Run `git log --oneline` to view the commit history.
```bash
echo "create a mock feature" > "notes.txt"
git add .
git commit -m "create feature-a branch with a mock feature in notes.txt"
git log --oneline
```
---

### Exercise 3: Switch Back to Main and Make a Change

**Goal**: Switch to the `main` branch and make a conflicting change.


✅ *Check*: View the file with `cat notes.txt`.
```bash
git checkout main
echo "create a different mock feature" > "notes.txt"
cat notes.txt
git add .
git commit -m "update main with a different mock feature in notes.txt"
```
---

### Exercise 4: Merge Feature Branch into Main (Expect Conflict)

**Goal**: Merge `feature-a` into `main` and resolve the conflict.


✅ *Check*: A merge conflict should occur. Open `notes.txt` and manually resolve:


Edit using your favorite text editor to combine or keep one version.

```bash
git merge feature-a
```
---

### Exercise 5: Squash Merge a Feature Branch

**Goal**: Use `--squash` to merge and squash all commits into one.


✅ *Check*: Only one commit should appear in the history after squashing.
```bash
git log --oneline
git merge --squash feature-a -m "squash feature-a onto main" 
git log --oneline
```
---

### Exercise 6: Clean Up Merged Branches

**Goal**: Delete local branches that have been merged.


✅ *Check*: Run `git branch` to confirm deletion.
```bash
git log --oneline --all
git branch -D feature-a
git push origin --delete feature-a
git branch
git log --oneline --all
```
## Hands-On #2: Merge Strategies

### Exercise 7: Use a Merge Strategy (`--no-ff`)

**Goal**: Create a new branch and merge with `--no-ff`.


✅ *Check*: `git log` should show a merge commit.
```bash
git switch -c git_branching_exercises_new_branch
git commit --allow-empty -m "make empty commit to git_branching_exercises_new_branch"
git switch main
git merge --no-ff git_branching_exercises_new_branch -m "perform empty no-ff merge of git_branching_exercises_new_branch onto main"
```
---

### Exercise 8: Fast-Forward Merge

**Goal**: Observe a fast-forward merge when no new commits exist on main.


✅ *Check*: Run `git log --oneline` — no merge commit is created.
```bash
git log --oneline
git switch -c git_branching_exercises_new_branch_2
git commit --allow-empty -m "make empty commit 1 to git_branching_exercises_new_branch_2"
git commit --allow-empty -m "make empty commit 2 to git_branching_exercises_new_branch_2"
git switch main
git merge --ff git_branching_exercises_new_branch_2 -m "perform empty ff merge of git_branching_exercises_new_branch_2 onto main"
git log --oneline
```
---

### Exercise 9: Rebase a Feature Branch

**Goal**: Rebase a feature branch onto the latest main branch.


✅ *Check*: The commit from `rebase-demo` will now appear after the `main` commit as if made later.
```bash
git log --oneline --graph
git switch main
git commit --allow-empty -m "new empty commit on main"
git switch git_branching_exercises_new_branch 
git commit --allow-empty -m "new empty commit on feature branch"
git log --oneline --graph
git rebase main
git log --oneline --graph
```
---

### Exercise 10: Squash Multiple Commits into One

**Goal**: Squash multiple commits into one before merging.


✅ *Check*: `git log` will show a single commit from the squash.
```bash
git log --oneline --graph
git switch git_branching_exercises_new_branch_3
echo "new feature 1 on git_branching_exercises_new_branch_3" >> notes.txt
git commit -am "add feature 1"
echo "new feature 2 on git_branching_exercises_new_branch_3" >> notes.txt
git commit -am "add feature 2"
echo "new feature 3 on git_branching_exercises_new_branch_3" >> notes.txt
git commit -am "add feature 3"
git switch main
git merge --squash git_branching_exercises_new_branch_3
git commit -m "squash git_branching_exercises_new_branch_3 onto main"
git log --oneline --graph
```
---

### Exercise 11: Rebase vs Merge – Compare Histories

**Goal**: Compare merge and rebase history using two branches.


✅ *Check*: Use `git log --graph --oneline --all` to visually compare linear (rebase) vs. branched (merge) history.
```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all
git switch -c git_branching_exercises_new_branch_4
echo "new feature 1 on git_branching_exercises_new_branch_4" >> notes.txt
git commit -am "add feature 1 on branch 4"
echo "new feature 2 on git_branching_exercises_new_branch_4" >> notes.txt
git commit -am "add feature 2 on branch 4"
git branch main
git switch -c git_branching_exercises_new_branch_5
echo "new feature 1 on git_branching_exercises_new_branch_5" >> notes.txt
git commit -am "add feature 1 on branch 5"
echo "new feature 2 on git_branching_exercises_new_branch_5" >> notes.txt
git commit -am "add feature 2 branch 5"
git switch main
git merge --no-ff git_branching_exercises_new_branch_5 -m "merge git_branching_exercises_new_branch_5 onto main"
git switch git_branching_exercises_new_branch_4
git rebase main
git log --oneline --graph --all
```
